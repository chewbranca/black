This is the source code for [Kenichi Asai](http://pllab.is.ocha.ac.jp/~asai/)'s Black programming language as described in the paper *Duplication and Partial Evaluation - For a Better Understanding of Reflective Languages*.

*the source herein is a WiP and will require a little work to get running in a Scheme interpreter.*
